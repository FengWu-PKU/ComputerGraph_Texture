CMake Deprecation Warning at third_party/assimp/contrib/zlib/CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):

  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


-- Build an import-only version of Assimp.
CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2022.1.3/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (rt) does
  not match the name of the calling package (RT).  This can lead to problems
  in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables (e.g.,
  `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  third_party/assimp/cmake-modules/FindRT.cmake:19 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  third_party/assimp/code/CMakeLists.txt:555 (FIND_PACKAGE)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
